## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [x] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [x] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added settings for button count, mistakes allowed, and pattern length.
- [x] Amount of buttons will appear and disappear to match the selected option.

_**2.** **What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)**_
* I struggled with creating the guess function. 
  * I was confused on what if-statement to use for the `Is turn over?` branch of the flowchart. 
  * I solved this issue by going back in the prework document to refresh on what each variable is intended to be used for. 
  * Reading what the `progress` variable is for gave me enough information to create an if-statement to handle the branch.
* I got stuck implementing the timer as I wasn't sure where to tell the timer to start. 
  * I resolved this by referring to how `setTimeout()` was used, which led me to find out how to use intervals and timeouts. 
  * Using this information, I used `setTimeout` to start the timer right after the sequence ended, and `clearInterval` and `clearTimeout` for when the game resets.
* I ran into issues when using audio clips instead of the tones. They would play, but they would only play once. 
  * After some browsing I found a stackoverflow question that was similar to mine that had a simple solution.
  * The solution was to set the audio clip's `currentTime` equal to zero, allowing `play` to be used again.
* Creating the demos was a struggle as there were many features to demo, some with audio.
  * I fixed this problem by creating a video to add along with my GIFs that would showcase all of the features I had implemented.
  * This solution provides more complete accessibility for the graders to view my work.

_**3.** **What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)**_
* I am interested in what security issues a web developer needs to worry about with HTML, since anyone viewing the webpage can see the HTML
* This makes me also wonder what the limitations are with standard HTML and JavaScript, as many websites today have more complex designs and functionality.
* I have many questions about HTML tag nesting abilities. I was able to put an image inside of a button, but I know that some tags can't properly be nested in certain tags.
* I know about local website hosting, but I wonder about the process of creating and hosting your own site for the world to see.
  * Furthermore, I wonder about database storage and how high traffic websites handle so much data fetching from their servers.

_**4**. **If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)**_
* Further improving the styling of the site to be more polished and eye-catching.
  * Could modify CSS or use Bootstrap
  * Apply custom fonts
  * Center the user interface
  * Make it scale effectively for different screen sizes
  * Replace alerts with an HTML element
* Make the settings into a popup menu instead of a fixed table.
* Remove ability to press buttons during pattern sequences.
* Prevent drag clicking
* Add more settings
  * Change time limit for guess
  * Option to play audio clip or tones
  * Option for images vs. no images
  * Volume options
* "Endless Mode"
  * No limit to pattern length
  * Pattern will continue to generate as long as user is correct
  * High scores could be saved
